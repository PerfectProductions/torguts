== Overview

This document describes the general structure of the Tor codebase, how
it fits together, what functionality is available for extending Tor,
and gives some notes on how Tor got that way.

Tor remains a work in progress: We've been working on it for more than
a decade, and we've learned a lot about good coding since we first
started.  This means, however, that some of the older pieces of Tor
will have some "code smell" in them that could sure stand a brisk
refactoring.
